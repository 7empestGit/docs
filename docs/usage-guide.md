# üß™ Usage Guide

## Initiating the Chroma client

```python
import chromadb
```

By default Chroma uses an in-memory database, which gets persisted on exit and loaded on start (if it exists). This is fine for many experimental / prototyping workloads, limited by your machine's memory.

```python
from chromadb.config import Settings
client = chromadb.Client(Settings(
    chroma_db_impl="duckdb+parquet",
    persist_directory="/path/to/persist/directory" # Optional, defaults to .chromadb/ in the current directory
))
```

The `persist_directory` is where Chroma will store its database files on disk, and load them on start.

The client object has a few useful convenience methods.

```python
client.heartbeat() # returns a nanosecond heartbeat. Useful for making sure the client remains connected.
client.reset() # Empties and completely resets the database. ‚ö†Ô∏è This is destructive and not reversible.
```

## Running Chroma in client/server mode

Chroma can also be configured to use an on-disk database, useful for larger data which doesn't fit in memory. To run Chroma in client server mode, run the docker container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Then update your chroma client to point at the docker container.

```python
import chroma
# chroma_client = chroma.Client() # before

from chromadb.config import Settings
chroma_client = chroma.Client(Settings(chroma_api_impl="rest",
                                        chroma_server_host="localhost",
                                        chroma_server_http_port="8000"
                                    ))
```

That's it! Chroma's API will seamlessly move over from `in-memory` mode to `client-server` with just this change.

## Using collections

Chroma lets you manage collections of embeddings, using the `collection` primitive.

### Creating, inspecting, and deleting Collections

Chroma uses collection names in the url, so there are a few restrictions on naming them:

- The length of the name must be between 3 and 63 characters.
- The name must start and end with a lowercase letter or a digit, and it can contain dots, dashes, and underscores in between.
- The name must not contain two consecutive dots.
- The name must not be a valid IP address.

Chroma collections are created with a name and an optional embedding function.

```python
collection = client.create_collection(name="my_collection", embedding_function=emb_fn, metric="dot", dimension=768)
```

The embedding function takes text as input, and performs tokenization and embedding. If no embedding function is supplied, Chroma will use [sentence transfomer](https://www.sbert.net/index.html) as a default.

You can learn more about [üß¨ embedding functions](./embedding-functions.md), and how to create your own.

Existing collections can be retrieved by name with `.get_collection`, and deleted with `.delete_collection`.

```python
collection = client.get_collection(name="test") # Get a collection object from an existing collection, by name. Will raise an exception of it's not found.
client.delete_collection(name="my_collection") # Delete a collection and all associated embeddings, documents, and metadata. ‚ö†Ô∏è This is destructive and not reversible
```

Collections have a few useful convenience methods.

```python
collection.peek() # returns a list of the first 10 items in the collection
collection.count() # returns the number of items in the collection
collection.modify(name="new_name") # Rename the collection
```

### Adding data to a Collection

Add data to Chroma with `.add`.

Raw documents:

```python
collection.add(
    documents=["lorem ipsum...", "doc2", "doc3", ...],
    metadatas=[{"chapter": "3", "verse": "16"}, {"chapter": "3", "verse": "5"}, {"chapter": "29", "verse": "11"}, ...],
    ids=["id1", "id2", "id3", ...]
)
```

If Chroma is passed a list of `documents`, it will automatically tokenize and embed them with the collection's embedding function (the default will be used if none was supplied at collection creation). Chroma will also store the `documents` themselves. If the documents are too large to embed using the chosen embedding function, an exception will be raised.

Each document must have a unique associated `id`. If you try to `.add` a document with an `id` that already exists in the collection, it will raise an exception.
An optional list of `metadata` dictionaries can be supplied for each document, to store additional information and enable filtering.

Alternatively, you can supply a list of document-associated `embeddings` directly, and Chroma will store the associated documents without embedding them itself.

```python
collection.add(
    documents=["doc1", "doc2", "doc3", ...],
    embeddings=[[1.1, 2.3, 3.2], [4.5, 6.9, 4.4], [1.1, 2.3, 3.2], ...
    metadatas=[{"chapter": "3", "verse": "16"}, {"chapter": "3", "verse": "5"}, {"chapter": "29", "verse": "11"}, ...],
    ids=["id1", "id2", "id3", ...]
)
```

If the supplied `embeddings` are not the same dimension as the collection, an exception will be raised.

You can also store documents elsewhere, and just supply a list of `embeddings` and `metadata` to Chroma. You can use the `ids` to associate the embeddings with your documents stored elsewhere.

```python
collection.add(
    embeddings=[[1.1, 2.3, 3.2], [4.5, 6.9, 4.4], [1.1, 2.3, 3.2], ...
    metadatas=[{"chapter": "3", "verse": "16"}, {"chapter": "3", "verse": "5"}, {"chapter": "29", "verse": "11"}, ...],
    ids=["id1", "id2", "id3", ...]
)
```

### Querying a Collection

Chroma collections can be queried in a variety of ways, using the `.query` method.

You can query by a set of `query_embeddings`.

```python
collection.query(
    query_embeddings=[[11.1, 12.1, 13.1],[1.1, 2.3, 3.2] ...]
    n_results=10,
    where={"style": "style1"}
)
```

The query will return the `n_results` closest matches to each `query_embedding`, in order.
An optional `where` filter dictionary can be supplied to filter the results by the `metadata` associated with each document.

If the supplied `query_embeddings` are not the same dimension as the collection, an exception will be raised.

You can also query by a set of `query_texts`. Chroma will first embed each `query_text` with the collection's embedding function, and then perform the query with the generated embedding.

```python
collection.query(
    query_texts=["doc10","thus spake zarathustra", ...]
    n_results=10,
    where={"style": "style1"}
)
```

You can also retrieve items from a collection by `id` using `.get`.

```python
collection.get(
	ids=["id1", "id2", "id3", ...],
	where={"style": "style1"}
)
```

`.get` also supports the `where` filter. If no `ids` are supplied, it will return all items in the collection that match the `where` filter.

### Updating data in a collection

Any property of items in a collection can be updated using `.update`.

```python
collection.update(
    ids=["id1", "id2", "id3", ...],
    embeddings=[[1.1, 2.3, 3.2], [4.5, 6.9, 4.4], [1.1, 2.3, 3.2], ...],
    metadatas=[{"chapter": "3", "verse": "16"}, {"chapter": "3", "verse": "5"}, {"chapter": "29", "verse": "11"}, ...],
    documents=["doc1", "doc2", "doc3", ...],
)
```

If an `id` is not found in the collection, an exception will be raised. If `documents` are supplied without corresponding `embeddings`, the embeddings will be recomupted with the collection's embedding function.

If the supplied `embeddings` are not the same dimension as the collection, an exception will be raised.

### Deleting data from a collection

Chroma supports deleting items from a collection by `id` using `.delete`. The embeddings, documents, and metadata associated with each item will be deleted.
‚ö†Ô∏è Naturally, this is a destructive operation, and cannot be undone.

```python
collection.delete(
    ids=["id1", "id2", "id3",...],
	where={"chapter": "20"}
)
```

`.delete` also supports the `where` filter. If no `ids` are supplied, it will delete all items in the collection that match the `where` filter.
