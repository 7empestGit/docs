# Chroma

**Chroma is the open-source embedding database**. Chroma makes it easy to build LLM apps by making knowledge, facts, and skills pluggable for LLMs.

Chroma gives you the tools to:

- store embeddings and their metadata
- embed documents and queries
- search embeddings

Chroma prioritizes:

- simplicity and developer productivity
- analysis on top of search
- it also happens to be very fast!

Chroma consists of a python client SDK, and a server application. Check out the [Colab notebook demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QEzFyqnoFxq7LUGyP1vzR4iLt9PpCDXv?usp=sharing).

Chroma is licensed under <underline>Apache 2.0</underline>.

```bash
pip install chromadb
```
